Commissioned by a prominent Melbournian, this mid-century home is an exemplar of energy-efficient design and timeless values. Each of the home's caretaker owners have preserved the architectural integrity the Chancellor and Patrick home whilst incorporating updates to keep it fresh. The most recent renovation focuses on the sunny dine-in kitchen where European appliances and aggregate concrete floor are a fine adjunct to the warm living room and a lush lawn surrounded by fruiting trees. Original floors and locally quarried stone synthesize a low-maintenance layout as relevant today as it was in the late 1950s. Meanwhile, views skipping over Kackeraboite Creek to Port Phillip Bay are a blissful reminder of the location's close proximity to Daveys Bay and its eponymous yacht club. A double lock up garage in Besser brick added more recently complements mature landscaping and stone paving with plenty of original details throughout including lights and feature timber wall panels.
